# Imagino.Ai
Imagino.ai is a web application that allows users to generate stunning images through AI using text prompts. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this project focuses on seamless UI/UX and smooth performance while integrating with AI-based image generation APIs.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (with modern hooks and components)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Other Tools: REST APIs, Axios, TailwindCSS (optional), Cloudinary(for image storage)

ðŸš€ Features:
Generate images from text prompts using AI API

5 credits free for new user.

View, download, and share generated images

Responsive and user-friendly interface

Stores image history for users (optional login system)

ðŸ’¡ Why this project?
Imagino.ai combines the creativity of AI with the robustness of full-stack development. While the image generation is powered externally by AI APIs, everything else â€” from prompt handling to UI rendering and data storage â€” is handled through a custom MERN stack solution.
